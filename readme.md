## The Potential Fake Guru List

[the list](sorted.md)

## Every PERSON mentioned across all CoffeeZilla episodes

At first I thought there would be a wealth of names on the CoffeeZilla playlists. I used SPACY to try to extract PERSON entities but it's not very good and extracted many random names and mistook name of non-persons for PERSON type. So this is a work in progress for sure. Perhaps such a list could be used in the future to improve the model.
